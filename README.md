# ECE484PinballMachine
Pinball Machine Project Designed by Parker Murphy, Frederick Levins, Jacob Bowens, and Carlo Buelvas


This repo is the central location for work contributed to the overall team project of Miami University Spring 2024 ECE 484 Class Final Project. The project involves development of a baseball themed pinball machine with the objective of successfully creating a fun and enticing game that is playable by all common pinball players. The project involves design, development, and integration of various functioning systems within the complete pinball machine, which allows for simulation of a real life industry system development cycle and project. As whole, this allows for us to be able to practice applying individual skills to a team orientated project which teaches us important skills ranged in communication, development, and team-work preparing us for the future in industry and allowing for us to explore and develop our team and individual skills.
