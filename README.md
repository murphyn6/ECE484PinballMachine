# ECE484PinballMachine
Pinball Machine Project Designed by Parker Murphy, Frederick Levins, Jacob Bowens, and Carlo Buelvas


This repo is the central location for work contributed to the overall team project of Miami University Spring 2024 ECE 484 Class Final Project. The project involves development of a baseball themed pinball machine with the objective of successfully creating a fun and enticing game that is playable by all common pinball players. The project involves design, development, and integration of various functioning systems within the complete pinball machine which allows for simulation of a real life indsutry system development cycle and project. As a whole, the project will look to integrate the development cycle of a project with the intedned outcome of a playbale and interactive basbelal theme pinball machine, effectivelly allowing us to learn aspects of what it takes to engineer and devlop qworkable porojects based on guidlines and time constraints preparing us for industry.
